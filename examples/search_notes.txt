=== MAIN ===
 1) Search for the artist name first - then search for the track within that artist name
 2) For each artist, from most likely to be correct to least, get every album.
 3) Search through each album for the track you want.
 4) If you found it, you are done. If not, go to the next artist and start from step 1.


=== GETTING ARTIST NAME ===
Search these, in this order:
 1) Whole channel name
 2) Powerset of channel name
 3) Powerset of video title
The order of these shows the priority, so if an artist is returned by option 1, don't query
the powersets until this artist has been searched for the track title.
